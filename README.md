# catstagram
Instagram for cats - project to learn Django and Javascript

This project uses Django/python for server side processing and storage and Javascript/HTML/CSS for client side interaction. The web hosting is done through heroku, with images stored in Amazon S3, and other databasing with postgresql.

To view the live website, go to http://cat-stagram.herokuapp.com.

Bugs to be fixed in the future:
1) posting a comment results in duplicate comments
2) red/green overlay should be changed to only appear for logged-in users
